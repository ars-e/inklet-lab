## The Brief {.section-title}

The Agri-Journal commissioned us to create a long-form digital story about the economic and climatic factors affecting mango cultivation in India. The goal was to move beyond dry academic analysis and create an engaging, memorable narrative for a broader audience, including policymakers, journalists, and consumers. They wanted a piece that felt both authoritative and accessible.

## Visual Strategy {.section-title}

How do you visualize a supply chain? We took inspiration from the humble mango crate—its labels, stamps, and textures—to build a visual language that felt authentic and tactile.

<br>

Our approach was rooted in the concept of a "digital PETI" (crate). We developed a design system that combined the aesthetics of industrial packaging with modern data visualization.
